## ❓ What does "Degoogling" mean?

**Degoogling** means **removing Google from your digital life** — including its services like Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, and more.

---

## 🚨 Why Degoogling?

* 🕵️‍♂️ Google collects massive amounts of personal data
* 🛡️ That data can be accessed, shared, and even leaked
* 🧠 They build detailed profiles based on your searches, emails, and behavior
* 🕳️ Participated in surveillance programs like **PRISM**
* ❗ Privacy is a right — reclaim it

📌 *"If others can do it, so can you!"*

## 🔒 Final Advice

> Using less software = less attack surface.

Don't just stop at replacing Google. Use **open-source**, **decentralized**, and **privacy-respecting** tools whenever possible.

> ✨ Your privacy is worth it.

## What does it mean?

Degoogling means to stop using anything that belongs to Google, anything that was made by Google. I'm talking about their search engine, their mail service (Gmail), Youtube, etc.


## Why Degoogle?

Google is one of the most powerful companies in the world right now. They have stored a huge amount of information on all of us. Some would argue that our information is safe with them because they know how to protect it. But this isn't true. Google has been penetrated before and it will be penetrated in the future. Maybe not by some script kiddie but it will be done by a nation state. Google stores personal information on all of us because this is how they make money.

They scan our emails, store what we search when we're using their search engine, what videos we watch on Youtube. This is how they target us and build a profile on us to show us some ad based on what we talked about with our best friend so they can show us an ad for something we need, but this is too creepy. Thanks to Mr. Snowden we now know that Google has shared our personal information with NSA under a program called **"PRISM"**.


In the future someone will be capable of accessing all that information and I assure you something really bad is going to happen. To prevent that from happening, you should start Degoogling right now. Also you shouldn't use products by a company that shares your data with **NSA**. You should put a stop to all of this by degoogling.

**If other people can do it, you can do it too.**

## What Now?

I have one little advice. If you can don't use any of the alternatives that are listed above. Using more applications increases your attack vector. It's possible that your data will be leaked someday. Not using Google apps doesn't mean that you're safe from Google. Companies like Google and Facebook continue to look for people to gather information about them so they can target them. So you have to take further measures to be safe from them. Also I want to say that there are lots of alternatives out there, I just listed few alternatives to see that it's possible to move away from Google.
